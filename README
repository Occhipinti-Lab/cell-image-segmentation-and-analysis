⚙️ Installation

Clone the repository and install dependencies:

git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/<your-repo>.git
cd <your-repo>
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate   # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt

🚀 Usage

Open the segmentation notebook:

jupyter notebook notebooks/01_segmentation.ipynb


Run segmentation on your .qptiff images.

Use 02_postprocessing.ipynb for mask cleanup and feature extraction.

Perform downstream analysis with 03_analysis.ipynb.

🔬 Features

Multi-resolution QPTIFF image support

Deep learning–based segmentation (e.g., Cellpose / transformer backends)

Automated tiling for large whole-slide images

Downstream analysis: feature quantification, visualization, and ML-ready outputs

📊 Example Workflow

Input: Multi-resolution .qptiff images

Segmentation → Cell masks

Feature extraction → Size, shape, intensity, biomarker expression

Analysis → Statistical summaries, visualization, machine learning
