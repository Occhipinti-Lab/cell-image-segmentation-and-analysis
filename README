## ⚙️ Installation  

Clone the repository and install dependencies:  

```bash
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/<your-repo>.git
cd <your-repo>
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate   # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

## 🚀 Usage  

1. Open one of the segmentation notebooks:  
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook notebooks/segmentation_by_cellpose.ipynb
   ```  
   or  
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook notebooks/segmentation_by_instanseg.ipynb
   ```  

2. Run segmentation on your `.qptiff` images.  
3. Use **`patient_analysis.ipynb`** for downstream analysis (mask cleanup, feature extraction, visualization, ML prep).

## 🔬 Features  

- Multi-resolution **QPTIFF image support**  
- Deep learning–based segmentation (Cellpose, InstanSeg, transformer backends)  
- Automated tiling for large whole-slide images  
- Downstream analysis: feature quantification, visualization, and ML-ready outputs  

---

## 📊 Example Workflow  

1. **Input**: Multi-resolution `.qptiff` images  
2. **Segmentation** → Cell masks  
3. **Feature extraction** → Size, shape, intensity, biomarker expression  
4. **Analysis** → Statistical summaries, visualization, machine learning
